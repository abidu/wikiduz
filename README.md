# Wikiduz

I decided to build a wiki as a way to improve my ability with python code. It will permit logged users to create new articles or edit old ones easily and should maintain a log of all changes made to each article. During the project I will be able to deal with relative complex aspects of databases, back ends and front ends.

## Getting Started

For the time being, the platform only uses webapp2 (an framework that used to be the default on Google App Engine) and has a very simple front end. The next steps are to rebuild everything to use the Flask framework, add a system that classify users in some categories and develop an elaborated front end.

## Development Roadmap

### Jan 2020 -- Mar 2020

* Translate app to Flask

* Create classification system for users

* Improve front end
